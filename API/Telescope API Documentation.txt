Classes:
	class.Telescope()
	- Instantiates a Telescope object as well as separate objects for the motors and encoders.
	- All public methods will be part of the telescope class, the other classes for the motors and encoders are mainly for compartmentalization and will ba handled through telescope().
	- Class variables:
		- (Motor) azMotor
		- (Motor) altMotor
		- (Encoder) azEncoder
		- (Encoder) altEncoder
		- (ndarray) targetAngle
	
	class.Motor()
	- Functionality to send the necessary signals to the controllers to rotate the motors by a precise amount.

	class.Encoder()
	- Functionality to interpret the I2C signal as an angular reading with respect to some reference angle.
	

Public Methods:
	telescope.getAngles(self, type=None)
	- Returns the current angular position of the telescope as read from the rotary encoders.
	- Parameters: 
		type: bool or {‘Az’, ‘Alt’} string, optional, default: None
		The desired type of angle to be returned; either the azimuthal angle, or altitudinal angle. Boolean values are 0 for azimuthal and 1 for altitudinal. If no type is given, the function will return the tuple (azAngle, altAngle).
	- Returns:
		out: tuple or float (might change it to an ndarray from numpy)
		The azimuthal and/or altitudinal angle of the telescope as read from the encoder(s).


	telescope.getAzAngle(self)
	- Calls telescope.getAngles(self, type=‘Az’)to return the azimuthal angle of the telescope as a float value.


	telescope.getPolarAngle(self)
	- Calls telescope.getAngles(self, type=‘Alt’)to return the altitudinal angle of the telescope as a float value.
