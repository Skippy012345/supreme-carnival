# Automatic Telesocpe Control
Welcome to the project page of the automatic pointing telescope. The goal of this project was to design, build, and program a mounting system for a telescope that is free to rotate in all directions without the need for the user to physically interact with the telescope. Such a system is more accurate, less finicky, and able to view the night sky remotely, without constant user monitoring. This project required us to design the hardware necessary for a maneuverable yet precise mounting system, the electronics necesary to rotate a 5 kg telescope and mounting system with about 30 arseconds of precision, as well as the software which controls the motors, calculation of required pointing angle, and the telescope as a whole.
